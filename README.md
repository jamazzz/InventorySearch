# InventorySearchOX
This Python script scans through your ox_inventory folder to identify image files that are either not referenced in any of the files or are missing from the folder. The script helps in cleaning up unused images and identifying missing assets.

# How to Use

1. Navigate to the directory containing your Python file and open it in your preferred text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

2. Locate the configuration section within the Python file and update the path to your inventory accordingly. Ensure that the path points to the correct location of your inventory data.

3. ** How to run ** 
- If you're using Visual Studio Code, simply press **F5** to start debugging. If the script doesn't execute as expected, you might need to install a Python extension for debugging.
- Alternatively, open the command prompt and run `python InventorySearch.py`.


# Requirements

- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. If not, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- **ox_inventory or qb-inventory**: You need one of these inventory systems installed to utilize the script.
